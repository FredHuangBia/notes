## Two Pointers
- Q3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Q11: Container With Most Water
- Q19: Remove Nth Node From End of List
- kSums (k >= 3)
- Two pointers are usually more more useful on sorted data
- Variant: slow - fast pointers

## Dynamic Programming
- Q5: Longest Palindromic Substring
- Q97ï¼š Interleaving String

## DFS
- Q39: Combination Sum

## BFS
- Q45: Jump Game II
- BFS usually is used to find "minimum number of steps" solutions.

## Greedy
- Q55. Jump Game

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
Could use a heap!

## Heap Sort
What's this?

## A*
Dijstra wit heuristic instead of using shortest path.

## Reverse!
Always think about solving the problem in reverse order. Such as problem 1048.

## Constrained programming
Update some state as invalid during the process. Such as mark a position as visited.

## Check a char in c++
```c++
isalpha(char)
islower(char)
isupper(char)
isdigit(char)
```
